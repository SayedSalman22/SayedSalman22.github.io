          <p>
            This is my website I have dedicated my time towards
            creating around the late iconic pop culture artist Michael Jackson
            and what it would have been like if he were still with us today.</p>

            <p>I was always fond of Jackson as my favourite artist of all time
            till today and wanted to post all my previous artwork on my website
            here to remember his legacy and show some interesting music concepts
            I have come up with in the past.</p>

            <p>
               Michael Jackson sadly passed away in August of 2009 just shy of his 50th birthday.
               he was known for revolutionising the music industry with reinventing what it meant
               to be an artist by including himself, his taste, and his persoanlity into everything in his career
               from outfits, to videos, to commericals. He was always in control of everything and was always
               keen on innovation just like when he invented the moon walk.</p>
