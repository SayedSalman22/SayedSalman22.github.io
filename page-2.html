          <p>
            Welcome to my gallery! This right here below is where you will find
            all the artwork I created in inspiration of Michael Jackson and
            what it would have been like to be able to collaborate with him as
            an artist. The main theme I had in mind when creating these artworks
            was I wanted it to make sense and really inspire the audience to
            check out his latest albums and concerts if he was still with us today.

            The main tools I used to produce these images were simply photoshop,
            Serif DrawPlus x8 and getting inspiration for colors and fonts from
            pinterest and looking at the history of his choosings in his music
            videos for album font colors, styles, outfits, lighting, just to name
            a few. Hope that you find my work pleasing and if you do share it with
            friends and family!

                This poster I produced in Photoshop was surrounding the ideas of as I said of
                the return of this marvellous pop music star Jackson in modern day and I desgined
                this poster as a magazine cover as I got inspired by magazines from back then
                surrounding my color choices and themes of life, death, and angels. Michael coming
                back is like saying he is immortal so I chose the name of this entire art collection
                of him being a celestial.</p>
